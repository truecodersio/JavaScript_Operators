# JavaScript_Operators

## Steps

1. Fork this repository to start a new project in your repos folder => `git clone <JavaScript_Operators>`
2. cd JavaScript_Operators to navigate into your new repo directory
3. Type the command code . to open VSC with the JavaScript_Operators folder
4. Open the app.js file

## Exercise 1

1. Declare 2 variables, `a` and `b`, and assign 20 to `a` and 4 to `b`
2. Declare a variable `add` that uses the `+` operator to store the result of adding the values stored in `a` and `b`
3. Declare a variable `minus` that uses the `-` operator to store the result of subtracting the values stored in `a` and `b`
4. Declare a variable `multiply` that uses the `*` operator to store the result of multiplying the values stored in `a` and `b`
5. Declare a variable `dividing` that uses the `/` operator to store the result of dividing the values stored in `a` and `b`

You can print the value of the variables to the browser console (ex: `console.log(add)`) to check the result.

## Exercise 2

1. Use the following code to answer the questions below:

```
let num = 11;
let str = "11";
let str2 = "eleven";
let isPresent = true;
let firstName = "Frodo";
let lastName = "Baggins";
```

- What is the value of: num + str?
- What is the value of: num + str2?
- What is the value of: num + isPresent?
- What is the value of: firstName + num?
- What is the value of: isPresent + str?
- What is the value of: firstName + lastName?

Use the code above to test and print the results.

## Exercise 3

1. Use the following code to answer the questions below:

```
let val = 5;
let str3 = "5";
let str4 = "five";
<<<<<<< HEAD
let isPresent = false;
=======
let isAwake = false;
>>>>>>> 016679ba03b8bb678017e4a0e74bc8eab8bd301f
```

- What is the value of: val == str3?
- What is the value of: val === str3?
<<<<<<< HEAD
- What is the value of: !isPresent?
- What is the value of: (“eleven” == str4 && val >= str3)?
- What is the value of: (!isPresent || isPresent)?
=======
- What is the value of: !isAwake?
- What is the value of: ("eleven" == str4 && val >= str3)?
- What is the value of: (!isAwake || isAwake)?
>>>>>>> 016679ba03b8bb678017e4a0e74bc8eab8bd301f
- What is the value of: 0 == false?
- What is the value of: 0 === false?
- What is the value of: 0 != false?
- What is the value of 0 !== false?

Use the code above to test and print the results.
